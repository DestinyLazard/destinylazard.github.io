    <p>I don’t wanna make this about me but I want you to understand some things:
Our relationship ups and downs never really were because of anything you did or didn’t do. It was always me. It always is me. I know I’m a lot. I know my emotions are all over the place sometimes. I know I  come with a lot. The mental battles I face scare me even. (Well, not anymore through recent breakthrough but we’ll get there.) You have never walked away and said I’m too much. My mental state has never intimated you. You are always there to try your hardest to help. I just never want you to rack your brain trying to figure out what you did wrong in the past with me that led to so many ups and downs. You have always been great to me!</p>
